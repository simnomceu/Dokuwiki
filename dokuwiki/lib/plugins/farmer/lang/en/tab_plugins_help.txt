===== Plugin Management =====

The extension manager is disabled in all Animals. Plugins can only be installed in the Farmer and only the Farmer
may control what plugins are enabled or disabled in all Animals. This is done through this interface.

A plugin can have three states in an Animal. It can be enabled (on) or disabled (off), or it can have the default state. The
default means that the state of a Plugin was not explicitly set for an Animal. Normally the default state is on.

When Animals are configured to inherit the Plugin state of the Farmer, a plugin in default state will have the same
state as in the Farmer. Eg. when you disable a plugin in the Farmer it will disable the plugin for all Animals which
did not have the state of this plugin explicitly set.

There are three ways to manage plugins: You can either pick a single plugin and set its state to the same value in all animals
or you can pick a specific animal and configure all the plugin states within that animal only. The third option allows you to
see and edit the state of all plugins in all animals at once. This option may not be feasible of you have a large amount
of animals.
