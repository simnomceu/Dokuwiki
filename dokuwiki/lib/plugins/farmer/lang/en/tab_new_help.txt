===== Animal Creation =====

Animals are the independent subwikis of a Dokuwiki farm. To create a new animal a name has to be assigned.

==== Animal Names ====

For .htaccess based setups this should be a single word. For domain based setups you should provide either a full qualified domain name.
If you use a wildcard subdomain setup you can also just provide the hostname part if you set a base domain in the configuration.

Examples:

  * .htaccess based: ''foo'' for an animal accessible at ''%%http://example.org/dokuwiki/!foo/%%''
  * domain based: ''%%www.foo.com%%''  for an animal accessible at ''%%http://www.foo.com/%%''
  * sub domain based: ''foo''  for an animal accessible at ''%%http://foo.example.com/%%''

The latter two require the appropriate DNS setup!

==== Copy Animal ====

You can select an existing animal to base the new one on. All configuration, page, media and meta data will be copied
to the new animal. Page and media revisions will not be copied.

The title and logo image will be overwritten to make sure you can distinguish the new from the old wiki.

==== Animal Administrator ====

The Animal will be a fully functional wiki with it's own user base. You will need at least one administrative user
to configure it. You can copy your current user or all users from the farmer or create a completely new user for the Animal.

You can choose to not create any users. This should only be chosen when inheriting users from the Farmer was enabled in the
configuration tab or you copied a different animal with existing users.
