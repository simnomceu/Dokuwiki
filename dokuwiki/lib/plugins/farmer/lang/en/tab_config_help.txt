===== Farm Configuration =====

All settings made here are saved to the Farmer's ''conf/farm.ini''.

==== Base Configuration ====

The **Farmer's host name** was set automatically during the setup, but you can change it here. It
will be used to detect if a request was made directly to the Farmer when using host based farms. This
should be a full qualified hostname (''foo.example.com'' instead of just ''foo'').

When using a subdomain wildcard setup you should specify the main domain in the **Base Domain** setting.
Eg. if you specify ''example.com'' it is assumed an animal named ''foo'' is reachable via ''foo.example.com''.
The base domain is only appended to animal names not containing any dots.

==== Inheritence ====

Here you can specify what configuration settings made in the farmer should be used as defaults in the animals.
Animals can still override the Farmer settings in their own configuration files. When inheritance is disabled,
DokuWiki's default settings are the defaults for all animals as well.

==== Non Existing Animals ====

By default, when accessing a non-existing animal no error message is shown. You can pick between different
behavior here. Be sure that your Farmer's host name is set up correctly above, before switching away from the
default.
